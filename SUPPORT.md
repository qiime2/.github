## Reporting bugs or requesting new features

If you'd like to file a bug report or feature request, we recommend starting with a post on the [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/).
If you're an experienced developer or user, you can alternatively post to a relevant issue tracker in the organization (if you're not sure which issue tracker to post to, it likely makes sense to start with a QIIME 2 Forum post).
